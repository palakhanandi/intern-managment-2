## Security Testing Using OWASP ZAP (Manual Testing)

1. OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy) was used to perform **manual security testing** on the dashboard website
2. The application URL was configured as the target and explored using the **AJAX Spider**
3. HTTP requests and responses were manually inspected through the ZAP proxy
4. **Security alerts generated by Active Scan and AJAX Spider** were reviewed, 
5. **role-based access control** was checked to ensure proper authorization
6. A **security testing report** was generated from OWASP ZAP summarizing detected alerts and observations

## Testing Outcome

- Manual security testing was successfully conducted using OWASP ZAP
- The AJAX Spider helped discover application endpoints and generate security alerts
- Most identified alerts were of **low to medium severity**
- Role-based access control ensured users could only access permitted dashboard features
- No critical security vulnerabilities were identified during testing
